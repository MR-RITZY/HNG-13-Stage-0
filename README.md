# üß† Backend Wizards ‚Äî Stage 0 Solution: Dynamic Profile Endpoint

## üéØ Overview
This project is my **Stage 0 submission** for the **Backend Wizards** program.  
It implements a RESTful API endpoint `/me` that dynamically returns my profile information along with a random cat fact fetched from a third-party API.

While the task looks simple, I approached it like a real backend service ‚Äî focusing on **asynchronous programming**, **clean architecture**, **logging**, **error handling**, **rate limiting**, and **environment-based configuration**.

---

## üß© My Solution Design

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Framework Choice ‚Äî **FastAPI**
I chose **FastAPI** because:
- It natively supports **async I/O**, perfect for making non-blocking API calls (like fetching cat facts).
- It provides **automatic validation** via Pydantic models.
- It‚Äôs lightweight yet production-ready.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Fetching Cat Facts Dynamically
Each `/me` request triggers an asynchronous call to  
[`https://catfact.ninja/fact`](https://catfact.ninja/fact) using **httpx.AsyncClient**.

- If the API responds successfully, I extract the `"fact"` field.
- If it fails (timeout, 5xx error, or invalid JSON), I catch the exception and log it, returning a fallback `"fact": "Could not fetch cat fact at the moment."` instead of breaking the request flow.

This ensures the endpoint remains **resilient and reliable**.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Dynamic UTC Timestamp
I use:
```python
datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat()
```
This ensures every response includes the **current UTC time in ISO 8601 format**, dynamically updated per request ‚Äî as required by the spec.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Response Validation
The structure is enforced using a Pydantic model (`ResponseReturn`) to guarantee:
- Strict schema compliance
- Type validation
- Consistent formatting

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ CORS Handling
I configured **CORS middleware**:
```python
allow_origins = ["*"]
```
This allows my endpoint to be called from any frontend or testing environment.  
It can easily be restricted in production by listing specific origins.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Error Logging
I configured two structured loggers using Uvicorn‚Äôs built-in system:
- `error_logger` ‚Üí logs failed API calls and exceptions.
- `info_logger` ‚Üí logs non-fatal events (e.g., when cat facts fail gracefully).

This helps in **debugging and monitoring** without printing sensitive data.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Rate Limiting
I implemented custom middleware using:
- **limits** (for rate-limit logic)
- **RedisStorage** (for distributed state)
- **SlidingWindowCounterRateLimiter**

Each client IP is limited to a certain number of requests per time window to prevent abuse if deployed publicly.

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Configuration Management
All environment variables (email, name, stack, Redis credentials, etc.) are handled using **pydantic-settings** via a `.env` file.

This keeps secrets out of source code and makes the app easily configurable in different environments.

## üí° Lessons Learned
- How to **consume third-party APIs** asynchronously.
- Handling **timeouts and network errors** safely.
- Using **Pydantic** for response validation.
- Managing **environment configs** securely.
- Integrating **Redis-based rate limiting** middleware.
- Importance of **logging and CORS configuration** in production APIs.
